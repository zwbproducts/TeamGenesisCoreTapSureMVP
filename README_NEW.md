**Questions the Bot Asks & Understands:**
1. Would you like to upload a receipt photo?

4. What category is your purchase: Electronics, Grocery, Clothing, or Pharmacy?
5. How much did you spend on this item?
6. Which coverage plan interests you: 6-month, 12-month, or 24-month?
7. Would you like to activate your coverage now?
8. Do you have another item you'd like to protect?

**Example Conversations:**
```
User: "Hi"
Bot: "👋 Welcome to TapSure! Here are questions you can ask me..." [Lists 8 questions]

```

## Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI + multi-agent modules (OpenAI optional)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (mobile-first, Tesseract.js for OCR)
- **Hosting:** Netlify (serverless static frontend)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Serverless (No Backend Required - Recommended for Testing)

```bash
# Start the frontend-only server on port 8082
cd /path/to/tapsure1
python3 -m http.server 8082 -d netlify-build
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8082**

Features:
- ✅ 100% serverless (runs entirely in browser)
- ✅ In-browser OCR via Tesseract.js
- ✅ Intelligent chatbot with 8 structured questions
- ✅ Code-gated access (enter: `TAPE-2025-PROMO`)
- ✅ Coverage recommendations & policy generation
- ✅ No backend API required

### Option 2: Full Stack (Backend + Frontend)

#### Backend Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Configure environment (optional - for LLM features)
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY if using OpenAI, or configure Ollama below

# Start the API
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/backend .venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
# In a new terminal, start the static server
python3 -m http.server 8082 -d netlify-build
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8082**

## Key API Endpoints

- `POST /api/receipt/analyze` — Analyze receipt image (multipart)
- `POST /api/coverage/recommend` — Get coverage options (JSON payload)
- `POST /api/flow/confirm` — Confirm and activate policy (JSON selection)
- `POST /api/chat` — Chat with the conversational agent (JSON {message})
- `GET /health` — Health check

## Authentication & Access Codes

The app uses a **code-gated access system**. Users must enter one of these codes on page load:

```
TAPE-2025-PROMO
INSURE-NOW-2025
COVER-2025-SALE
PROTECT-BUNDLE
```

To modify valid codes, edit `netlify-build/assets/app.js`:
```javascript
const VALID_CODES = ['TAPE-2025-PROMO', 'INSURE-NOW-2025', 'COVER-2025-SALE', 'PROTECT-BUNDLE'];
```

## Coverage Categories & Pricing

The chatbot automatically recognizes purchase categories and provides 3 coverage tiers:

| Category | Base Rate | 6-Month (0.45x) | 12-Month (0.75x) | 24-Month (1.1x) |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Electronics | $45 | $20.25 | $33.75 | $49.50 |
| Grocery | $15 | $6.75 | $11.25 | $16.50 |
| Clothing | $25 | $11.25 | $18.75 | $27.50 |
| Pharmacy | $10 | $4.50 | $7.50 | $11.00 |

**Price adjustments:** Premium scales with purchase amount. For example:
- Bought a $1500 laptop → Electronics rate × (1500/100) = $45 × 15 = $675/month base
- 6-month plan: $675 × 0.45 = $303.75/month

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional - for LLM/Backend features)

```bash
# LLM Configuration
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1  # For Ollama or OpenAI-compatible API
LLM_API_KEY=your-api-key                # Leave empty for Ollama
LLM_MODEL=llama3.1:8b                   # Model name

# Or use OpenAI directly
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# OCR Configuration (Backend)
TESSERACT_CMD=C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe  # Windows only
```

### Free Setup (No Paid APIs)

1. **Install Tesseract OCR** (for backend OCR):
   - Download: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
   - Set `TESSERACT_CMD` in `backend/.env`

2. **Install Ollama** (for local LLM):
   - Download: https://ollama.com/download
   - Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`
   - Set `LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1`

3. **Configure backend/.env:**
   ```
   LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
   LLM_API_KEY=ollama
   LLM_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
   ```

## Deployment

### Deploy to Netlify (Static Frontend Only)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI (requires Node.js >=20)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Authenticate
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --dir=netlify-build --prod
```

Your app will be live at: `https://your-app.netlify.app`

## Architecture

- **Orchestrator** — Coordinates agent workflows (receipt analysis, coverage recommendation, policy confirmation)
- **ReceiptAnalyzer** — Uses Tesseract.js (browser) or pytesseract (backend) for OCR
- **CoverageRecommender** — Deterministic pricing engine (no external calls)
- **ConversationalAgent** — Intelligent chatbot with 8 structured questions and phrase recognition

## 🎯 What's New (Latest Updates)

✅ **Code-gated access** — 4 valid promotional codes required on page load
✅ **Intelligent chatbot** — Recognizes 9 phrase categories and 8 structured questions
✅ **Natural language parsing** — Understands purchase descriptions ("I bought a MacBook for $1500")
✅ **WhatsApp-style chat UI** — Message bubbles, proper formatting, emoji indicators
✅ **Coverage tier recommendations** — 6/12/24-month plans with automatic pricing
✅ **Policy generation** — Unique policy IDs with confirmation details
✅ **Serverless deployment** — 100% client-side, runs on Netlify without backend
✅ **Browser-based OCR** — Tesseract.js in-browser image recognition

## Notes

- The app runs **100% serverless** by default (no backend required)
- OCR happens in the browser using **Tesseract.js** (free, open-source)
- All chat logic is client-side (pure JavaScript)
- Optional backend provides advanced LLM-powered features
- Code-gated access prevents unauthorized uploads
- Policies are generated with unique IDs and can be extended with backend persistence

## Troubleshooting

- **"Code modal won't go away"** — Enter a valid code from the list above
- **"OCR not working"** — Tesseract.js requires a few seconds on first load; ensure image is clear
- **"Backend not reachable"** — The app automatically falls back to 100% client-side mode
- **"Port already in use"** — Try a different port: `python3 -m http.server 8083 -d netlify-build`
- **"Chatbot not understanding me"** — Try phrases from the "Phrases the Chatbot Recognizes" section above
